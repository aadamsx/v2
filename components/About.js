            ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I&apos;m Shashikanth Reddy, a frontend developer based in
            India. Building web applications with appealing design while keeping
            it&apos;s functionality is what I strive for. I&apos;m into frontend
            development from past one year. Since then I&apos;ve been building
            projects to develop my skills. I&apos;m also learning backend
            development and looking forward to be a full stack developer.

            Currently, I&apos;m pursuing under-graduation in the field of
            Information Technology. I&apos;m interested in JavaScript
            technologies. Some of the frontend technologies which I worked with
            and would like to work with in the future are Next.js, React, Redux,
            Styled components, Tailwind CSS, Firebase etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m actively looking for opportunities where I can utilize my
            skills and learn new things at the same time. Do consider me if you
            have one.
