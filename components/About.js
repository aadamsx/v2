            ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Shashikanth Reddy, a frontend developer based in India.
            Building web applications with appealing design while keeping it's
            functionality is what I strive for. I'm into frontend development
            from past one year. Since then I've been building projects to
            develop my skills. I'm also learning backend development and looking
            forward to be a full stack developer.

            Currently, I'm pursuing under-graduation in the field of Information
            Technology. I'm interested in JavaScript technologies. Some of the
            frontend technologies which I worked with and would like to work
            with in the future are Next.js, React, Redux, Styled components,
            Tailwind CSS, Firebase etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm actively looking for opportunities where I can utilize my skills
            and learn new things at the same time. Do consider me if you have
            one.
